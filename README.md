# Gallifreyan Tools
A collection of tools for fanmade Gallifreyan scripts, mostly scripts I've created. All Python files were written for Python 3.10.

## Tools
### Spinner Gallifreyan
- Efficiency: CSV files showing how efficient every word in the NLTK wordlist is in terms of rings per word, including if you don't use Y as a vowel and if you don't use digraphs. Also includes the Python code used to create the files (requires nltk).

### Stopwatch Gallifreyan
- Efficiency: Same as the Spinner version, except quarters per word and modified for Stopwatch's digraphs.
- sentence-discs.py: Enter a sentence, without punctuation, and it'll tell you how many discs the sentence will need, plus how many blank quarters there will be. (To-do: punctuation handling.)
